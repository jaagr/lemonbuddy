     * - Builds a second graph. The nodes are sections and (u, v) is and edge,

     * - The topological order of this second graph is calculated and all
     *   sections without an inherit key are ignored.
     * - The topological order is reversed, the sections are traversed in
     *   that order, and the keys of the inherited sections are pulled in.
